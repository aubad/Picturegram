In Assignment2 
I couldn't post new comments on the website.The issue was fixed using the method Post
before the form block. 
The text on top of the background image of the navbar in posts.php was generic. Customised texts and dates
according to each posts were added.
The php code lacked comments. Comments were added to increase the understandability of the code
The posts and comments were in ascending. The issue was fixed by ordering the date of the posts
and comments in descending order.
